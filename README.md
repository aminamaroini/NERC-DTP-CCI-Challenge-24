# Earth Observations Solutions for Extreme Heat and Drought Events: 

## Managing Urban Heat Islands in the Global South and Enhancing Decision-Making for UK Droughts and Heatwaves

### To run the notebooks and access the data stored in the CEDA archive on JASMIN, you will need to clone this repository in your JASMIN Notebooks service account.

This repository contains two notebooks for the two proposed challenges:

### 1. Using EO data to support decision-making for UK droughts & heatwaves 

In recent years, periods of hot, dry conditions in the UK have led to severe droughts and heat stress, with many negative impacts on water resources, ecosystems and human health. With climate change, droughts and heat stress will likely worsen and occur more frequently in future.

Your challenge is to use multiple sources of Earth Observation data (potentially including Reanalysis data) to create a product that will help a customer in the UK adapt to or mitigate against the impacts of droughts and extreme heat. For example, you may choose to develop a product to aid decision-making for farmers, city dwellers, urban planners or water companies. Depending on your chosen customer, you will explore which of their needs are currently unmet but could be addressed using Earth Observation data. As part of this challenge, you will also be able to design communication and dissemination strategies, to ensure that your customer gains access to the relevant data and information.

The aim of this challenge are:

-	Get acquainted with and use observational (and reanalysis) climate data (netCDF files)
-	Identify target customers that are affected by droughts and heatwaves
-	Explore how earth observation data can be translated into useful resources for customers
-	Transform earth observation data into information relevant for decision making
-	Design communication and dissemination strategy

### 2. Using EO data to identify & mitigate urban heat islands in the Global South

Urban environments experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings. These higher temperatures can negatively impact human health, including causing cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, as well as heat stroke. It is therefore crucial to be able to identify and better prepare for Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) in order to lower heat stress exposure in urban environments.
Your challenge is to use multiple sources of Earth Observation (EO) data to create knowledge, products, or services that will help a chosen client in the Global South to identify UHIs within their city and inform on the risk to the local population.
As part of the challenge, you will also think about how your client can effectively uptake your knowledge, products, or services and implement it for adaptation or mitigation purposes.
If you choose to focus on mitigation strategies, you should consider how to translate the gained knowledge into actionable information for your given clients (i.e., local practitioners or other stakeholders). Focusing on adaptation strategies will require thinking of suitable solutions (e.g. nature-based solutions) to reduce the urban heat islands of your chosen region. Regardless of the specific focus, you should think through the general challenges of capacity building in the Global South and develop a project plan that tries to tackle the identified challenges. 

The aim of this challenge are:

-	Get acquainted with and use observational climate data: This challenge will remain conceptual, but we encourage students to plot urban heat island maps with EO data, and to construct risk maps of exposure by combining EO data with socio-economic datasets to illustrate their project. 
-	Identify clients in the Global South that are affected by urban heat islands
-	Explore how EO data can be translated into useful resources for clients
-	Identify challenges of capacity building in the Global South
-	Develop a project management plan for a proposed capacity building approach, that tries to tackle the identified challenges to ensure real user-uptake and implementation of the created knowledge/product/service
